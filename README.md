# World's Best Cricketers

Presenting to you the worlds finest cricketers, from swing-bowling technichians, unrelenting intent driven batsmen, hit-the-deck bowlers, to fortresses in front of the sticks

The three formats(T20, 50 over & Test) will be represented and further segregated into the three player classifications(All-Rounders, Batsmen, Bowlers)

## ALL-ROUNDERS

"Anything you can do, I can do better"--said every all-rounder worth their salt ever step foot on the playing surface, missing out with the wood normally see's swift vengence with the cork & leather, multi-faceted highly skillful gentlemen on the game, the true perfectionists
